# 🎯 Number Guessing Game (Java)

Welcome to my **Number Guessing Game** — a fun and interactive Java console project where the computer generates a random number, and the user tries to guess it within limited attempts! 

---

##  Project Description

This is a simple Java-based game that runs in the terminal.  
The computer randomly picks a number between **1 and 100**,  
and your goal is to **guess the correct number** in as few attempts as possible.

Each round gives you **limited attempts**, and you can **play multiple rounds**.  
Your **score** is calculated based on how quickly you guess the correct number.

## Features

✅ Random number generation between 1 to 100  
✅ Feedback for each guess (too high / too low / correct)  
✅ Limited number of attempts per round  
✅ Option to play multiple rounds  
✅ Score system based on performance  
✅ Fully interactive console output

##  How It Works

1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.  
2. The user enters their guesses.  
3. The program provides hints:
   -  "Too low" if your guess is smaller  
   -  "Too high" if your guess is larger  
4. You get only a fixed number of tries per round (default: **7 attempts**).  
5. If you guess correctly, you earn points based on remaining attempts.  
6. You can choose to play again and continue scoring.
